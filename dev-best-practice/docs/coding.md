# Coding Best Practice

Here is a list of common **coding best practice**s you should consider.

* When creating a new branch to start working on any type of code change, add a **unique identifier** associated to that branch name

* **Commit early** and often, I recommend using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
> **_NOTE:_** 'feat: adding in the section on best practices [ATO-05]'
* Try to **avoid using abbreviations** in your code - spell things out and make sure your variable names make sense for what is being stored in them
* Wait until all **pull request comments are resolved*** before you merge your code
> **_NOTE:_** *within reason - make sure you have something related to this added into your teams working agreement
* **Clean up branches** on both your local and remote
