# Documentation

**Documentation** is possibly one of the most important things to write besides the code and tests. There are also several types of documentation. There is **documenation in the code** where comments are added above functions, there is documentation that can **live in the code base**, and there is documentation that can also **exist outside** of the code base. Just remember, if a **change** is made, think about **updating the documentation**.
