# Conclusion

In **conclusion**, I have highlighted the **best practices** that I have encountered over the years in my journey as a professional.

No matter which step in the lifecycle, it is always important to **automate, be consistent, name things appropriately, and keep scope as small as possible**.

Ultimately it comes down to **what the team decides** in terms of what is adopted, however I highly encourage and advocate for these practices.
