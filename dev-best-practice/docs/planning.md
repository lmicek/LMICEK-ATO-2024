# Project Planning

**Project plannning** and related tools give the ability to **track the work** and **link the code changes back to a requirement**.

When there is an **issue** in an application, it is helpful to **isolate** down to a particular change, which in turn minimizes the time to **fix the code** than if best practices were not followed.
