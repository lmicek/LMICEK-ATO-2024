# Project Planning

**Project plannning** and related tooling allow you to **track the work** you are doing and **link the code changes back to a requirement**.

It also helps when there is an **issue** in an application, and you are able to **isolate** it down to a particular change, which will allow you to **fix the code** in a shorter amount of time than if you didn't do these types of practices.
