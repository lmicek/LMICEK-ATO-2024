# Testing

Here is a list of common best practices you should consider when you are **testing**.

* Research a **testing framework** to use for whatever language you are using
* Hopefully code has been written with the single responsibility principle in mind, so that your test can be **small in scope**
> **_NOTE:_** you can always refactor the code
* Keep tests **organized, independent, and repeatable**
* Make sure you are **covering more** than just a happy path
* Make sure your tests are **consistent** and you have proper code coverage
> **_NOTE:_** aim high
