# Testing

Here is a list of common best practices to consider when **testing**.

* Research a **testing framework** to use for whatever language is being used
* Hopefully code has been written with the single responsibility principle in mind, so that the test can be **small in scope**
> **_NOTE:_** refactor the code when needed
* Keep tests **organized, independent, and repeatable**
* Make sure that more than just a happy path is being **covered**
* Make sure tests are **consistent** and have proper code coverage
> **_NOTE:_** aim high
