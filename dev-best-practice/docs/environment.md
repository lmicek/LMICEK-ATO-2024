# Setting Up a Development Environment

**Setting up a development environment** is something that should come **after planning** and **repo creation**. Now it is known **what** is being made and **where** it will live. One of the **first** things I do when I start a new repo is start to fill out the **'README.md'**. This is not a one time code change, and will need to be **updated** whenever a **change** is made to something about the code that another person who clones the repo should be able to **understand** when they use it.
