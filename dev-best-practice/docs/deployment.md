# Deployment

Here is a list of common best practices you should consider for **deployment**.

* Make sure whatever you're using for deployment, can be **automated** but also triggered manually 
* Pay attention to your **logs** when issues arise
* Use a file that can run your deployment steps so that it can be **version controlled** alongside your code
* Keep steps **lean and clean**
> **_NOTE:_** don't try to cram everything into one step
* Use **consistent and meaningful** naming conventions
